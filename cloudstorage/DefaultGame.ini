; Aurora uses the Fortnite hotfix system in order to make actions like modifying in-game localization text possible.
; Developers may wish to use this line of code below as a reference whenever they'd like to replace text ingame.
; +TextReplacements=(Category=Game, bIsMinimalPatch=True, Namespace="REPLACE_ME_NAMESPACE", Key="REPLACE_ME_KEY", NativeString="REPLACE_ME_NATIVE", LocalizedStrings=(("ar","REPLACE_ME_LOCALIZED"),("en","REPLACE_ME_LOCALIZED"),("de","REPLACE_ME_LOCALIZED"),("es","REPLACE_ME_LOCALIZED"),("es-419","REPLACE_ME_LOCALIZED"),("fr","REPLACE_ME_LOCALIZED"),("it","REPLACE_ME_LOCALIZED"),("ja","REPLACE_ME_LOCALIZED"),("ko","REPLACE_ME_LOCALIZED"),("pl","REPLACE_ME_LOCALIZED"),("pt-BR","REPLACE_ME_LOCALIZED"),("ru","REPLACE_ME_LOCALIZED"),("tr","REPLACE_ME_LOCALIZED"),("zh-CN","REPLACE_ME_LOCALIZED"),("zh-Hant","REPLACE_ME_LOCALIZED")))

; Documentation:
; 	"Namespace" - Text category, per locres
; 	"Key" - Text string key to be used during replacement, per locres
; 	"NativeString" - The original text
; 	"LocalizedStrings" - Consists of a table of text replacements for each language code, as well as the replacement text for that specific language.
;
;	Note: Language codes must conform to the ISO 639-1 standard and/or RFCs 5646 and 4647
;	(basically, if you were to replace text for the English language you would want to use the official code "en".)
;	(Other languages may/may not have multiple spoken/written variants, e.g.: English (en for international (ISO 639-1), en-US for United States, en-GB for United Kingdom/Great Britain)

; An example can be exhibited here:
; +TextReplacements=(Category=Game, bIsMinimalPatch=True, Namespace="PartyContext", Key="BattleRoyale", NativeString="Battle Royale", LocalizedStrings=(("en","Lorem Ipsum")))
; 
; The line above essentially attempts to replace the "Battle Royale" text with "Lorem Ipsum" in language "English".
